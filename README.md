### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Enrique CÃ¡rdenas-SÃ¡nchez
A passionate Volcanologist and geophysicist.
## My works
- Iâ€™m currently working on Risk Analysis and mitigation of volcanic hazards by remote sensing (thermal camera) on active volcanoes in MÃ©xico. **Grain-size distribution and thermal energy release by Vulcanian/Strombilian eruption**
- My next paper is related to estimating the heat transfer coefficient (conductivity and surface heat transfer coefficient) by using diverse sensors like thermocouples and a thermal camera. The objective is to develop a new cooling rate model to approximate the grain-size distribution by volcanic eruption. Using the cooling rate model and thermal images, we can extrapolated to different size of clast ejected during an eruption, like Popocatepetl or Volcan de Colima. 

## My new projects
-   Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with risk analyst in Port-City-Region including Manzanillo City considering anthropologic and natural hazard oriented to the affectation of the supply chain. **Anthropologic and natural hazard in the chain of subministers.** -

## Looking for co-workers
-   Iâ€™m looking for help with Matlab Programmers oriented to Machine Learning and deep learning looking for pattern recognition and inverse method applied to hazard by tsunamis. **Impact on the supply chain produced by Tsunamis.** 

## About my codes
-   In my github repo you can find diverse codes developed to Matlab and/or Octave (due to compatibility it is not 100%).
-   My software is a significant part of my work, but it was designed to solve some specific problems for my thesis and some consulting jobs.
-   If you have questions about my codes, please contact me at my institutional and personal email
