### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Enrique CÃ¡rdenas-SÃ¡nchez
A passionate Volcanologist and geophysicist from Colima, Mexico.
## My works
- Iâ€™m currently working on Risk Analysis and mitigation of volcanic hazards by remote sensing (thermal camera) on active volcanoes in MÃ©xico. **Grain-size distribution and thermal energy release by Vulcanian/Strombilian eruption** -
-## My project
-   Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with risk analyst in Port-City-Region including Manzanillo City considering anthropologic and natural hazard oriented to the affectation of the supply chain. **Anthropologic and natural hazard in the chain of subministers.** -
##Looking for co-workers
         Iâ€™m looking for help with Matlab Programmers oriented to Machine Learning and deep learning looking for pattern recognition and inverse method applied to hazard by tsunamis. **Impact on the supply chain produced by Tsunamis on the coasts of Colima and the city of Manzanillo.**
